Please note that hotel booking is not part of the AKBC conference registration process. Your registration confirmation email will include a reference group code for access to reserved hotel rooms for AKBC attendees, which you should then book separately. Note that hotel rooms may fill up and are only held until 19 April, so make sure to book yours as early as possible. The tentative registration timeline is:

* March 7th, 2019: Author/Speaker Conference+Hotel Registration opens
* March 14th, 2019: Public Registration opens, [Register Now!](https://umass.irisregistration.com/Home/Site?code=AKBC)

### <a name="visa"></a> Visa Information:

The B-1 Visa is a nonimmigrant tourist visa.  For official visa information please see:

[https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html)

[https://www.usa.gov/visa](https://www.usa.gov/visas)

The non-refundable visa application fee is approximately $160.

We can provide you with a confirmation letter for the
      conference. Please email [pmandler@cs.umass.edu](mailto:pmandler@cs.umass.edu) a request including the title of your paper (if you had one accepted) and your physical address.

#### Electronic System Travel Authorization (ESTA)
ESTAs may be cheaper and easier to obtain than a visa. Go to [https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html) to see if you are eligible. Be sure to apply for the ESTA at least 72 hours in advance. Do not purchase your ESTA from any website other than the one linked above.
